Postmortem Report: Web Project Outage Incident
Issue Summary:
•	Duration:
The outage occurred from 12:00 PM to 2:30PM 
•	Impact:
The outage affected our primary web service, causing a complete service downtime. Users experienced an inability to access the site and its associated features. Approximately 87% of our user base was affected.
•	Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a database query bottleneck due to a recent code deployment that introduced inefficient SQL queries.
Timeline:
•	Issue Detected:
The issue was detected at 11:45PM when our monitoring system generated an alert for a significant spike in database query response times.
•	Actions Taken:
•	The incident response team immediately initiated an investigation into the issue.
•	Initial assumptions pointed to potential hardware failures or network issues, so the operations team was brought in to assess these components.
•	Debugging efforts initially focused on the application layer, as it was assumed that the code deployment might have introduced a bug.
•	Subsequently, the database administrator team was also involved to investigate the database health.
•	Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:
The initial belief that hardware or network issues might be responsible led to a brief diversion of resources towards these areas. However, further analysis revealed that the problem was centered around the database.
•	Escalation:
As the investigation pointed toward a database-related issue, the incident was escalated to the development team, specifically to the team responsible for the recent code deployment.
•	Incident Resolution:
The incident was resolved by identifying the inefficient SQL queries and optimizing them. The development team rolled back the problematic code and implemented the optimized queries. Service was fully restored after a database cache flush.
Root Cause and Resolution:
•	Root Cause:
The root cause was an inefficient SQL query introduced by a recent code deployment. The query's complexity, coupled with the large dataset it processed, caused significant degradation in database performance.
•	Resolution:
The issue was fixed by optimizing the SQL queries to improve database response times. The development team rolled back the problematic code to a stable version and implemented the optimized queries. Additionally, a database cache flush was performed to ensure consistent performance.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
•	Improvements/Fixes:
•	Implement rigorous code review and testing processes to identify potential bottlenecks before deployment.
•	Enhance monitoring and alerting for database performance to detect issues more proactively.
•	Tasks to Address the Issue:
1.	Review and optimize all SQL queries in the codebase.
2.	Develop and implement stricter code deployment policies with comprehensive testing.
3.	Enhance real-time monitoring for database query performance.
4.	Conduct a post-mortem meeting to share lessons learned and improves incident response processes.
5.	Implement a rollback plan in case similar incidents occur in the future.
